# rental-of-game-consoles
This is my first serious project. This project is a web application for renting game consoles in Brest. To implement the project, I will use the MERN technology stack, I considered this stack the most suitable for the implementation of my project (and to tell the truth, I just like JS and I want to improve my programming skills on JS)
